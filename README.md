# 400A_2023
This repository contains my solutions and work for the fall 2023 semester section of ASTR 400A, Astronomy + Astrophysics of Stars, 
at the University of Arizona (Professor: Kaitlin Kratter). For copyright reasons, I do not include the text of the assignments. 
I also exclude the MESA model files I used to prevent my solutions from being directly copied by students in future sections.
